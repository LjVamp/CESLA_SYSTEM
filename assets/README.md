# Assets Folder

This folder will contain your app icons and images.

## Files needed later (optional):

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024px)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (48x48px)

For now, the app will run without these files. You can add them later when you're ready to build the final APK.

## How to add icons:

1. Create or download your icons
2. Place them in this `assets/` folder
3. Update `app.json` to reference them
4. Run `expo start` again

The app will work perfectly fine without icons during development!
